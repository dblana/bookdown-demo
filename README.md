This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown). Please see the page "[Get Started](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/get-started.html)" at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/ for how to compile this example into HTML. You may generate a copy of the book in `bookdown::pdf_book` format by calling `bookdown::render_book('index.Rmd', 'bookdown::pdf_book')`. More detailed instructions are available here https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/build-the-book.html.

You can find the preview of this example at https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown-demo/.

Notes: 

- in RStudio, "Build Book" instead of Knit (otherwise navigation did not work for me)
- go to the _bookdown.yml file and add output_dir: "docs" on a line by itself
- in the book github repo, go to Settings --> GitHub Pages --> master / docs folder (see [here](https://help.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site#choosing-a-publishing-source))
